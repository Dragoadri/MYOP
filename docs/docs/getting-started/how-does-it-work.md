# How does openpilot work?

openpilot can upgrade the advanced driver assistance system in 275+ cars. Three parts are needed to do this: a compatible car, a comma 3X, and a car harness.


## a

## comma 3X

## car harness


The car harness canonicalizes the car-specific connectors to something standard for the comma ecosystem.
