# What is openpilot?

openpilot is an operating system for robotics.

openpilot's first application is an open source [driver assistance system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_system).

Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW).

In addition, openpilot features a camera-based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature that alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about [the vehicle integration](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/docs/INTEGRATION.md) and [limitations](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/docs/LIMITATIONS.md).

## How do I use it?

openpilot is designed to be used on the [comma 3X](https://www.comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).

## How does it work?

In short, openpilot uses the car's existing APIs for the built-in [ADAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_system) system and simply provides better acceleration, braking, and steering inputs than the stock system.
