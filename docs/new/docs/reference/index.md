This section would have things that aren't essential to being able to start developing with openpilot.

Maybe we can add:

- Up to date specs on comma3x hardware. Lightning hard versus old circuit board.
- How comma 3x is made. It's essentially just what Adeeb walked through during the "Touring comma HQ..." livestream but in a blog post format with pictures of each station and the parts that come out of it.
